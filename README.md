# 🌌 Binary Star Instabilities

Welcome to the **Binary Star Instabilities** repository! This project explores the dynamics of binary star systems, focusing on the instabilities that arise during mass transfer processes. The study combines analytical models, computational simulations, and numerical analysis to understand the complex interactions between stars in binary systems, with a particular emphasis on Roche lobe overflow and circumbinary structures.

## 🔍 Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- **Mass Transfer Dynamics**: Investigate the conditions under which mass transfer between binary stars becomes unstable, leading to significant changes in the system's evolution.
- **Roche Lobe Overflow**: Analyze the impact of Roche lobe dynamics on the stability of binary star systems.
- **Circumbinary Torus**: Simulate the formation and evolution of circumbinary torus structures around binary systems.
- **Computational Simulations**: Use numerical simulations to model the evolution of binary star systems and the resulting instabilities.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`rochelobe_pt2.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of Roche lobe dynamics and mass transfer in binary star systems.
- **`circum_binary_torus.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook that simulates the formation and evolution of a circumbinary torus around a binary star system.
